# Tensorflow_tutorial
This is a code repository for the tensorflow tutorial. The tutorial was published by Peking University, presented by Assistant Professor Jian Cao. Anyone who needs the tutorial videos can find them online in Chinese University Mooc.
## 1.Basic knowledge of Tensorflow ##
There is a simple example of iris classificaiton using the dataset loaded from sklearn library. In this example, `iris_classification.py`, you can find a very strightforward way to realize iris classification by neural network with tensorflow.
## 2.Basic knowledge of Neural networks ##
Learning rate, activation function, loss function, regularizer and optimizer are introduced in this section. Learning rate is a parameter that controls the model's learning speed, or a step model learns. It should be properly selected as if it is too large, the model won't converge, while too small will make the model converge too slow. Activation function is something that makes your output fit some kind of distribution. Loss function helps to evaluate the model and it is also what you rely on to refresh model parameters and optimizer is the way you use to refresh your model. Regularization is a method to help reduce overfitting. 
There is an example, `regularization.py`, that shows the differences when a model has regularization or not. The data is `dot.csv`
## 3.Baseline of setting up a model (six-step method) ##
coming soon
